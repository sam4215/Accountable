# Accountable
A simple and lightweight accounting software. Brought to you by Sam!

Accountable is licensed under the MIT license.

#Overview
Accountable is a command-line interface that helps make payroll *that* much easier. Upon first launch, Accountable will prompt you to enter a "Default Employee" payroll user. This is to make your life easier when setting up individual employees. For the "Default Employee", NO FIELD CAN BE LEFT BLANK. After this is complete, you will be prompted to create an individual employee account. You do not have to complete every field, entering a minus one '-1' will set that field to that of the default employee account. Note that you may never have a blank, only a value or -1. After setting up an employee, you will be asked if you would like to set up another employee. If you are done, simply type "n". This will save the data and exit. Typing "y" will bring you to the add employee interface.
#Don'ts:
Accountable may not work properly if you do any of these. So, please, DO NOT:
- Edit the files in the 'data' folder: This is what the lovely interfaces in the program are for! If you edit these files with notepad, notepad++, Microsoft Word, or ANYTHING it might corrupt the data and then Accountable can't read it and now you're sad because your data is lost and I'm sad because you clearly didn't read this.
- Try changing the names of any files that Accountable comes with, ever. Then Accountable can't reach its files and guess what? Nothing works!
- Claim this software as your own. You can edit, remix, whatever. Just give credit and do not violate the license. The MIT license is legally binding and you can go to court and be sued. Really. A copy of the license can be found in the LICENSE file.
- Violate the End User License Agreement (EULA), if I ever add one. See above.

#Planned Features
- C++ wrapper, launching the program seamlessly.
- Support for a Company/Organisation field, somewhere.
- MySQL support (not high priority)
